#
# Want a stream of Session objects
# with acquitions objects including the object label and id, and the files from aloha's interest
#
# Aloha input verifier must check there is a single baseline session, and at least one followup session.
# Within the baseline session, there 
# Segmented T1/T2/Left/Right AlohaInput file.
# Within each follow up, there must be a single T1/T2 AlohaInput file.  There may be multiple
# NotAlohaInput and MaybeAlohaInput files
#
# When the verifier runs, it updates the session timestamps and sets the Session and File Tags according
# to the AlohaGearJson.  New Sessions/Files may be added during this time.
# The verifier has a Full and a Relevant mode, where it only shows the files Aloha will use in Relevant
# and it will show all the files the Verifier knows about and their state in Full mode.
# The verifier can be run in update and check modes
